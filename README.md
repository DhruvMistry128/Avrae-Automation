# Avrae-Automation
A collection of automation I've designed for use with the D&amp;D Discord bot called Avrae. The documentation of which can be found here: https://avrae.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

The language used in Avrae aliases is a custom modified version of Python, called Draconic. In most cases, Draconic uses the same syntax and base types as Python - any exceptions noted in the documentation.
